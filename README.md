# Salesman
A java program to help you find out all about your favourite salesmen! 
# NOTE
- Currently the bug-fixing code uses debug-only function's which print's out redundant things: **THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION**
- This is my first java project, so i may write some bad code in here
- This project is designed for me to write good code so the development will be slow
- Using POP OS (Debian-Based) And releasing packages in every major updat
- Thanks if you star the project!
# BUGS
Project development slow because of use of bug-stopping functions (working on them)
